- Software engineer (full-stack) for more than 12 years;
- Trusted with leadership for 9 of those years;
- Director of a [non-profit](https://unnamed.group/) since 2016;

### Informally...

I'm an [avid gamer](https://zue.dev/steam) and a hobbyist musician in my spare time. On the weekends I can usually be found DM'ing games such as Dungeons & Dragons and Cyberpunk RED with my friends. I'm nearly always listening to music and programming something, probably working on my latest game or open-source project.
